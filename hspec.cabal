synopsis:         A Testing Framework for Haskell
description:      Hspec is a testing framework for Haskell. It is inspired by
                  the Ruby library RSpec. Some of Hspec's distinctive features
                  are:
                  .
                  * a friendly DSL for defining tests
                  .
                  * integration with QuickCheck, SmallCheck, and HUnit
                  .
                  * parallel test execution
                  .
                  * automatic discovery of test files
                  .
